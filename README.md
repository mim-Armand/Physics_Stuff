# Notions ( in no order ):

- **CCC theory** ( Conformal Cyclic Cosmology ): In Roger Perose's CCC, the universe iterates through infinite cycles, with the future timelike infinity of each previous iteration being identified with the Big Bang singularity of the next. Penrose popularized this theory in his 2010 book Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe.
- **Local hidden-variable theory**: in the interpretation of quantum mechanics is a hidden-variable theory that has the added requirement of being consistent with local realism. It essentially explains that un-locality does not exist and can be explained by a hidden variable ( IE the measurment would be predictable if we knew that hidden variable )
- **Bell's theorem**: Bell's theorem proves that quantum physics is incompatible with local hidden-variable theories. It was introduced by physicist John Stewart Bell in a 1964 paper titled "On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen Paradox", referring to a 1935 thought experiment that Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen used in order to argue that quantum physics is an "incomplete" theory.
- **Brewster's angle**: Brewster's angle is an angle of incidence at which light with a particular polarization is perfectly transmitted through a transparent dielectric surface, with no reflection. When unpolarized light is incident at this angle, the light that is reflected from the surface is therefore perfectly polarized.
- **Stern–Gerlach experiment**: experiment demonstrated that the spatial orientation of angular momentum is quantized. Thus an atomic-scale system was shown to have intrinsically quantum properties. In the original experiment, silver atoms were sent through a spatially varying magnetic field, which deflected them before they struck a detector screen, such as a glass slide.
- **Squeezed Vacuum**: Quantum squeezed states are a consequence of uncertainty relations; a state is squeezed when the noise in one variable is reduced below the symmetric limit at the expense of the increased noise in the conjugate variable such that the Heisenberg uncertainty relation is not violated.
- **parametric down-conversion**: Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (also known as SPDC, parametric fluorescence or parametric scattering) is a nonlinear instant optical process that converts one photon of higher energy (namely, a pump photon), into a pair of photons (namely, a signal photon, and an idler photon) of lower energy.
- **Two-photon emission**: It's a better, mor efficient alternative to the BBO crystal mechanism of parametric down-conversion. >> [Observation of two-photon emission from semiconductors](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphoton.2008.28)
- **Positron Catalysed Nuclear Fusion**: decay of a radio-active material produces pairs of positron-electrons, which using a magnetic field and an array of coolers ( to reduce the speed of hot postrons ) postrons will be redirected to a reactor to catalyze the mechanism, PostronDynamics's working on this as a means of propulsion.
- **The Chinese Room Argument**: It argues agains Alan Turing prediction where if a computer can convince a human that it's a human. it says that if you put a person who doesn't understand Chinese in a room with an instruction book / dictionary, then he receives a message in Chinese and responds using instructions, that doesn't make him Chinese or undrestand it.
- **Cherenkov radiation**: Cherenkov radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the group velocity of light in that medium. A classic example of Cherenkov radiation is the characteristic blue glow of an underwater nuclear reactor. but it's also used to detect Neutrinos in Super Kamiokande observation for instance.
- **MOND**: (Modified Newtonian dynamics) Modified Newtonian dynamics is a hypothesis that proposes a modification of Newton's law of universal gravitation to account for observed properties of galaxies.
- **Chirp cooling**: (or **Laser-Cooling** or **Zeeman Cooling**) is the method of using the photon momentums to slow atoms down ( cooling them ) from an atom beam with an opposite direction to near absolute zero in a region of space.
- **Doppler cooling**: in this method we essentially use the doppler effect and a bunch of lasers from different directions with an off-resonant lower frequency than the atoms to trap them in-place and taking the motion (heat) out of them.
- **Zeeman effect**: The Zeeman effect is the effect of splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field. It is named after the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman, who discovered it in 1896 and received a Nobel prize for this discovery.
- **Stark effect**: The Stark effect is the shifting and splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external electric field. It is the electric-field analogue of the Zeeman effect.
- **Objective-collapse theory**: or Objective reduction, Objective-collapse theories, also known as models of spontaneous wave function collapse or dynamical reduction models,[1][2] were formulated as a response to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics,[3] to explain why and how quantum measurements always give definite outcomes, not a superposition of them as predicted by the Schrödinger equation, and more generally how the classical world emerges from quantum theory. The fundamental idea is that the unitary evolution of the wave function describing the state of a quantum system is approximate. It works well for microscopic systems, but progressively loses its validity when the mass / complexity of the system increases.
- **Equivalence principle**: fundamental law of physics that states that gravitational and inertial forces are of a similar nature and often indistinguishable, originally stated by Galileo. In Einstein’s version, the principle asserts that in free-fall the effect of gravity is totally abolished in all possible experiments and general relativity reduces to special relativity, as in the inertial state.
- **Energy-Frequency equivalence** Max Planck equation E = hc/λ.
- **Mass–energy equivalence** Einstein's famous Equasion E = mc^2.
- **Copernican principle**: In physical cosmology, the Copernican principle states that humans, on the Earth or in the Solar System, are not privileged observers of the universe. Named for Copernican heliocentrism, it is a working assumption that arises from a modified cosmological extension of Copernicus's argument of a moving Earth.

# Other ( more philosophical ) notions:
- God Of Gaps: is a theological perspective in which gaps in scientific knowledge are taken to be evidence or proof of God's existence.
- Noblesse oblige: Based on Schrödinger it means you should not talk about topics that you are not an expert in ( not sure if that's what it means tho! and I'm not an expert in it!! )
- **Single-event upset**: when high energy particles change a bit in our digital devices ( like the super-mario jump that happened in 2013 or 1979, when Ziegler from IBM and Lanford from Yale for the 1st time described the process and added shielding to ICs, that the same year world’s first heavy ion “single event effects” test at a particle accelerator facility, conducted at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's 88-Inch Cyclotron and Bevatron. or the Quantas airline flight incident )
- **Goodstein's theorem**: n mathematical logic, Goodstein's theorem is a statement about the natural numbers, proved by Reuben Goodstein in 1944, which states that every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at 0. Kirby and Paris[1] showed that it is unprovable in Peano arithmetic (but it can be proven in stronger systems, such as second-order arithmetic).
- **Orch OR**: Orchestrated objective reduction, is a controversial hypothesis that postulates that consciousness originates at the quantum level inside neurons, rather than the conventional view that it is a product of connections between neurons. The mechanism is held to be a quantum process called objective reduction that is orchestrated by cellular structures called microtubules. It is proposed that the theory may answer the hard problem of consciousness and provide a mechanism for free will. --> In Orch-Or the Orch is for Orchestration and Or is for Organization.
- **kernel theorem**: In mathematics, the Schwartz kernel theorem is a foundational result in the theory of generalized functions, published by Laurent Schwartz in 1952. It states, in broad terms, that the generalized functions introduced by Schwartz (Schwartz distributions) have a two-variable theory that includes all reasonable bilinear forms on the space {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}}{\mathcal {D}} of test functions. The space {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}}{\mathcal {D}} itself consists of smooth functions of compact support.
- **Goldbach's conjecture**: One of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states that every even whole number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.
- **Penrose Consciousness**: Roger penrose have said that he sees 3 parts in Consciousness: intelligence understanding and awareness.
- **Occam's razor**: Occam's razor, Ockham's razor, Ocham's razor (Latin: novacula Occami), also known as the principle of parsimony or the law of parsimony (Latin: lex parsimoniae), is the problem-solving principle that "entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity",[1][2] sometimes inaccurately paraphrased as "the simplest explanation is usually the best one.
- **Being Anti Copernican**, hints at the notion that at the time of Copernicus, Galileo's ideas was rejected because one could not feel the earth moving.
