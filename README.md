# Notions ( in no order ):

- **CCC theory** ( Conformal Cyclic Cosmology ): In Roger Perose's CCC, the universe iterates through infinite cycles, with the future timelike infinity of each previous iteration being identified with the Big Bang singularity of the next. Penrose popularized this theory in his 2010 book Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe.
- **Local hidden-variable theory**: in the interpretation of quantum mechanics is a hidden-variable theory that has the added requirement of being consistent with local realism. It essentially explains that un-locality does not exist and can be explained by a hidden variable ( IE the measurment would be predictable if we knew that hidden variable )
- **Bell's theorem**: Bell's theorem proves that quantum physics is incompatible with local hidden-variable theories. It was introduced by physicist John Stewart Bell in a 1964 paper titled "On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen Paradox", referring to a 1935 thought experiment that Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen used in order to argue that quantum physics is an "incomplete" theory.







# Other ( more phylosophycal ) notions:
- God Of Gaps: is a theological perspective in which gaps in scientific knowledge are taken to be evidence or proof of God's existence.
