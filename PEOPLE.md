- Bryce DeWitt, University of Texas, he was the one who made Hugh Everett known to the world by writing a popular account in Physics-Today journal at 1970 and pushed his ideas of many-worlds, before which he was pretty much ignored. (It was all his fault!) He expressed his reservations to Hugh which made Hugh to add a foot-note saying that his ideas are likely anti-copernicane in the times of Galileo ( who didn't feel the earth was moving just like one would not feel being split into many worlds! )
- Hugh Everett III, He essentially proposed that the collapse of wave function to a single point happens because every single point of the wave is measarable in a different world, causing many different worlds.
